This poster was created using ArcGIS, Tableau, Excel, and adobe InDesign. 


Here is breakdown of what each software was used for:

ArcGIS:

- Creating the non contiguous cartogram

Tableau:

- creating pie charts

InDesign:
- Compiling exports from ArcGIS, Tableau, & excel in to one place
- Adding text and layout


## Included in this repo is a data folder and a folder with my work.
### Data:
- A .csv containing all the points I used. Data was collected from https://afdc.energy.gov/data_download. The exact parameters are
- A .png screenshot from the website containing exact parameters I used to download

### The folder with my work includes:
- A tableau workbook (.twbx) which shows exactly how I set up my variables. This can be opened in tableau reader which doesn't require a subscription but doesn't allow you to modify the workbook at all
    - notes:
        - ignore sheet 1 in the tableau workbook
        - sheet 2 was used for visualizing before exporting the graph.
        - sheet 3 is a copy of sheet 2 just with no background enabled, the sheet that I exported
